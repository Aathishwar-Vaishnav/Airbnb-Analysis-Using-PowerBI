üìñ What is Airbnb?
Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for short-term and long-term homestays and experiences. Founded in 2008 in San Francisco, the platform connects hosts with available accommodations to travellers looking for lodging.

üîç How Airbnb Works
The Airbnb model is straightforward:
‚Ä¢	Hosts list properties‚Äîwhether it's a room, apartment, or entire home‚Äîon the platform.
‚Ä¢	Guests browse listings, book stays, and enjoy unique, often affordable, lodging experiences.
‚Ä¢	Airbnb handles payments, trust, and support, charging a commission for each booking.

Streamlit
 In the 'Home' section of our project, users can explore detailed hotel information by selecting a country. This feature provides an overview of each hotel, including price, room type, description, and ratings.
 In the 'Discover' section, users have the opportunity to explore countries through dynamic geo-visualizations, supplemented with price insights.
 In the 'Insight' section, users explore two categories: 'Top Insights' and 'Filtered Insights'. 'Top Insights' offer pre-defined queries with insightful analysis, while 'Filtered Insights' allow users to select specific criteria for tailored visualizations
 
Power BI
Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations and insights derived from the Airbnb dataset. It allows you to explore various aspects of Airbnb listings, including pricing trends, property types, and geographical distributions.
