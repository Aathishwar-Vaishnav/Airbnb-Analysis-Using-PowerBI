# Airbnb-Analysis-Using-PowerBI
Project Overview
This project explores the Airbnb dataset (2019) to derive insights from property listings, focusing on trends in the travel industry, tourism, and property management. By leveraging tools like Python, MySQL, Streamlit, Plotly, and Power BI, this project delivers an interactive and comprehensive dashboard for data analysis and decision-making.

📖 What is Airbnb?
Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for short-term and long-term homestays and experiences. Founded in 2008 in San Francisco, the platform connects hosts with available accommodations to travelers looking for lodging. Airbnb operates in over 220 countries and regions, offering an alternative to traditional hotels by providing home-like stays with the convenience of digital bookings.

🔍 How Airbnb Works
The Airbnb model is straightforward:

Hosts list properties—whether it's a room, apartment, or entire home—on the platform.

Guests browse listings, book stays, and enjoy unique, often affordable, lodging experiences.

Airbnb handles payments, trust, and support, charging a commission for each booking.
